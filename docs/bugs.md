While our instructions should work on most devices, sometimes there will be bugs that we might have missed due to some devices having older drivers, or simply Linux/WSL being difficult. Let us know if you find one here and we will do our best to post a fix on the [Fixes blog](https://olincollege.github.io/ClashofTanks/blog/).
