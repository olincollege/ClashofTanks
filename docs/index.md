The Atari 2600, released in 1977, revolutionized the home video game console industry by allowing users to 
play a variety of games using interchangeable cartridges. The console was a massive success, selling 
millions of units and ushering in a new era of video games. One of the most popular games on the Atari 2600 
was "Combat," a PvP game that allowed two players to battle each other on different stages while maneuvering 
around various obstacles to try and destroy each other's tanks. The game became an instant classic and was 
included as a pack-in game with the console for many years. Despite the simple graphics and mechanics, 
"Combat" provided endless hours of entertainment for players and helped cement the Atari 2600's status as an 
iconic piece of gaming history.

In order to bring this experience back, we decided to make a simple remix of the game in Python using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library.

When choosing assets and a GUI style, we tried to keep the simplistic nature of the controls and objectives from the original game to preserve its authenticity. That's why we kept the pixelated tank icons, barebones GUI, and a one-button start feature. This is how games used to work when Combat was first released, and it was essential for us to recreate that nostalgic feeling and achieve our stylistic goal.
