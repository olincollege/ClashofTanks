title: Welcome to our remake of the classic "Tank" game!
---

As sad as it is, not many people use retro gaming consoles anymore. To combat this injustice, we decided to turn back the clock and bring a game from the distant past to more modern screens.

The Atari 2600 was a video games console released in 1977, and while the hardware is outdated, the games playable on it remain as iconic as ever. In particular, the classic "Combat" PvP game allowed 2 friends to plug in controllers and battle each other on different stages, as they maneuvered around different maps to try and destroy each other's tanks.

To bring this experience back, we decided to make a simple remix of the game in Python using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library.

When choosing assets and a GUI style, we tried to keep the simplistic nature of the controls and objectives from the original game to preserve authenticity. This is why the tank icons are pixelated, the GUI is very barebones, and you only need to press one button to start playing. This is how games used to work when Combat came out, and trying to recreate the nostalgic feeling was important to us when making our stylistic choices.
