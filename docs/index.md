As sad as it is, not many people use retro gaming consoles anymore. To combat this injustice, we decided to turn back the clock and bring a game from the distant past to more modern screens.

The Atari 2600 was a video games console released in 1977, and while the hardware is outdated, the games playable on it remain as iconic as ever. In particular, the classic "Tank" PvP game allowed 2 friends to plug in controllers and battle each other on different stages, as they maneuvered around different maps to try and destroy the other tank.

To bring this experience back, we decided to make a simple remix of the game in Python using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library.
